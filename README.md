# Details

*Medical Image Processing Online (MedIPO)* is a web based application which offers their users a quick and easy way to upload, view, process and analyze MR images online. The system aims to provide an online viewer and image analyzer for medical doctors by providing a detailed and intractable interface.

The system also offers a semi-automated segmentation tool that enables a medical doctor to specify the region of interest in one slice of the MR image and it conducts a semi-automated segmentation of this region over the rest of the slices. The semi-automated segmentation highlights any abnormal mass tissue in the MR images. The system also allows the user to enter manual annotation and corrections in addition to the segmentation results.
